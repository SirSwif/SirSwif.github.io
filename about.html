        <h2>About This Newsletter</h2>
        <p>
            My newsletter covers topics such as AI writing and AI image generation. These areas interest me because they have been a
            major talking point over the past few years, and it is exciting to see how quickly they continue to develop. I am curious
            about where these technologies will go in the future and how they will continue to shape creativity, education, and
            everyday digital work.

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Sam, and this is my second year at Lindenwood University. I am majoring in Interdisciplinary Studies, which allows
            me to explore different areas and understand how they connect with one another.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some of my interests include gaming, baseball, and movies. I enjoy how each of these combines creativity, competition, and
            storytelling, which is part of what draws me to studying new technology like artificial intelligence.
