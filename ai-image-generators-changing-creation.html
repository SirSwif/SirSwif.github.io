                AI image generators are quickly becoming popular tools for students, allowing them to create pictures from simple text
                descriptions. These tools use artificial intelligence to turn written prompts into artwork, making it easier to design
                visuals for school projects, presentations, and creative assignments.

            <p>
                With AI image generators, students can type what they want to see, such as “a castle on a mountain at sunset” or
                “a scientist in a futuristic lab,” and receive an image within seconds. This saves time and helps students who may not
                have strong drawing or graphic design skills. It also encourages creativity by letting ideas come to life in a visual form.

                Some of the most well-known tools include DALL-E, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion. Each platform has its own strengths.
                Some focus on realistic images, while others create more artistic or imaginative styles. Students often use these tools
                for posters, book covers, history projects, science diagrams, and digital art assignments.

            <p>
                However, the growing use of AI image generators has also raised important questions. Many people are concerned about
                copyright and how these tools are trained on existing artwork. Teachers are encouraging students to use AI responsibly
                and to be clear about when and how they use these tools in their work. This helps maintain honesty and learning in the
                classroom.
            </p>

            <p>
                Overall, AI image generators are changing the way students approach creative tasks. By making visual creation faster and
                more accessible, these tools are helping students express their ideas in new and exciting ways.
